# Auth0 + Cordova + API Seed

This is the seed project you need to use if you're going to create an app that will use Auth0, Cordova and an API that you're going to be developing. That API can be in any language.

## Running the example

In order to run the project, you need to have `node`, `cordova` and `ios-sim` installed.
Once you have that, just clone the project and run the following:

1. `cordova platform add ios`
1. `cordova build ios`
1. `cordova emulate ios`

Enjoy your Cordova app now :).
